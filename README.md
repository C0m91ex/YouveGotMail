## Highlighted Features

- Drag and drop gameplay -- drag emails into the trash bin to increase your score!
- Like any great clicker game, you can purchase upgrades and power-ups to improve your efficiency from the in-game shop
- Experience different endings with our storylet narrative design, opening different emails leads to new paths..
- Build connections with different people through emails and discover your own identity.

You've Got Mail offes a unique gameplay experience combining 2 game genres: narrative & clicker games. 
One of our favorite attributes of our game is that it can be played in 2 different ways, experiencing both the clicker 
and narrative aspects or playing it solely as a clicker/narrative game. 

The player will start off assuming the unknown identity of some employee working for a large corporation, and as you 
receive & read more emails you learn more about your own identity while building connections with an array of individuals.

Dear Employee of the Company...
